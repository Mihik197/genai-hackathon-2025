- It is December 2025 as of now
- Always refer to the latest documentation. Do not hallucinate deprecated APIs. Prefer looking up documentation of languages/frameworks/apis online.
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Do not overuse overly defensive try-except statements everywhere. Only use them where truly needed
- When building frontends, do not use generic typography and iconography (e.g. lucide-react). Use beautiful typography and icons
- When building frontends, create beautiful, responsive interfaces with great UX.
- Write modular code. Remember the DRY principles
- links to some important documentations:
    - google-genai library (google-generativeai has been deprecated): https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/llms.txt
    - google agent development kit (ADK): https://google.github.io/adk-docs/llms.txt
- When integrating LLMs in our project, we will mainly be using one of these three depending on the use case: 'gemini-3-flash', 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite'
- no emojis please
- do not write unnecessary comments
