2. FinTech: Money moves fast - your AI should move faster.

Description: Build solutions for fraud detection, smart investing, financial inclusion, or next-gen payments. Make finance safer, smarter, and accessible to all.

Specific Challenges:
- Real-time Fraud Detection: Design a deep learning model to instantly analyze transaction patterns and flag anomalies with extremely low latency, specifically targeting synthetic identity fraud or money laundering across diverse datasets.
- Generative Investment Strategies: Create a Gen AI model that can synthesize financial news, market sentiment, and macroeconomic data to generate novel, risk-adjusted investment portfolios or trading strategies.
- Financial Inclusion for the Underserved: Develop a credit-scoring model that uses non-traditional data (like mobile usage, utility payments, or community behavior) to reliably assess creditworthiness for individuals without a formal banking history.
- AI-Powered Compliance (RegTech): Build a tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to read and summarize complex financial regulations, automatically cross-referencing them against a bank's internal policies and highlighting areas of non-compliance.
